# R_Project_CDC_MASK
I investigated the impact of the CDC's mask loose policy announced in May 2021 on foot traffic in Walmart stores. I downloaded foot traffic data from May 1st to May 31st in nearly all states in the US and used regression models to analyze the relationship between the policy change and foot traffic. Additionally, I included other potentially relevant variables such as vaccine hesitancy and partisan support rates in different states to provide a more comprehensive analysis. To present my findings more effectively, I also created geographic graphs to compare the results across different states.
